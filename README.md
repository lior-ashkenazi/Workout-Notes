# Workout Notes

A website that aims to provide a platform for those who are passionate about
exercising: Workout Notes provides a platform where users can conveniently keep
all the acquired information about their workout regimens in a responsive
and intuitive way in a world where media services are overabundant and
disorganized with that sort of information.

I had the chance to get experience utilizing React.js, HTML3, and CSS5 in this
project (by using the Tailwind CSS framework).
